Building:

If you have the GCC plugin developer tools available, you should be
able to build by simply running 

$ make

To get the GCC plugin developer tools on Ubuntu, load the following
packages using apt:

apt-get install gcc-x.y-plugin-dev

where x.y corresponds to the version of GCC installed on your computer.

Running:

When compiling with gcc, use these extra command line flags to use the
plugin:

$ gcc test.c -o a.out -fplugin=<path to bb_stats.so>/bb_stats.so -fplugin-arg-bb_stats-output=<output file>

That should be it!
