Building:

If you have the GCC plugin developer tools available, you should be
able to build by simply running 

$ make

To get the GCC plugin developer tools on Ubuntu, load the following
packages using apt:

apt-get install gcc-x.y-plugin-dev

where x.y corresponds to the version of GCC installed on your computer.

Testing:

$ make test

should result in a test.out and an a.out file if everything built.

Running:

When compiling with gcc, use these extra command line flags to use the
plugin:

$ gcc test.c -o a.out -fplugin=<path to bb_stats.so>/bb_stats.so 

You can use an optional second parameter to name the output file:

$ gcc test.c -o a.out -fplugin=<path to bb_stats.so>/bb_stats.so -fplugin-arg-bb_stats-output=<output file>

If you do not specify the output file, the result will be stored in a file automatically. That output file will be named the same as the main input file with the addition of a .bb extension. If the input file contains a path (and /s), those delimiters will be replaced with _s.

That should be it!
